# XYZ

This project is more like a sandbox than a game.
The first goal was to learn how to develop some features related to 3D fps games.

Today the project is paused, but i ended up creating many features.
I developped myself each 3D model used in this game (enemies, weapons, pick up), and I created the associated animations when needed.
I created some basic AI for both enemies, using a state machine.
I created a 3D character and weapon controller, allowing to move easily and use or swap weapon correctly.
I also created an intermission panel based on the one used in the Starcraft 1 game.
